THEOREM PROVING ALGORITHM

Gӧdel’s incompleteness theorems introduces a new class of mathematical statements, statements are still either true or false; 
however, true statements can either be provable or unprovable within a given set of axioms.

It follows at once that undecidability exists in both: Peano's axiomatic number theory and ZFC axiomatic set theory. 

To remedy these limitations and guided by our metamathematical P=NP theorem, the creation of a stronger and independent (from 
classic axiomaric systems), efficient and effective higher order logic theorem prover algorithm is hereby introduced: 



CÖMPENDIUM
Is a transduction algorithm for machine learning ML based on transductive inference, it goes beyond mere induction or deduction 
and thrives on undecidable propositions, for its core dwells a three value logic system.

Our theorem prover algorithm goes beyond mere checking  procedures, for it learns  how to utilize all the parts, all samples and 
abstract concepts of all possible solutions  which CÖMPENDIUM is exposed to, CÖMPENDIUM is in effect a specialist TPA  on the 
subject matter.

NOTE:
 
If we consider the whole entirety of potential knowable mathematical knowledge as the union of classic mathematics and 
metamathematics, then the former is but 1/4 of it, while the later encompasses the remaining 3/4 of it all. 

We designed CÖMPENDIUM knowing that metamathematical techniques will universally improve all mathematical knowledge.
